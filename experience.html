<div class="info"><p id="expsize">You can easily see a lot of the park in 6-7 days. You don't need a guided tour but you do need a car. If you have 7 days, ideally I would want to spend 2 nights at Old Faithful, 2 nights at Mammoth and 3 nights at Canyon or Lake. This gives you different area of the park to zoom in on. If you are looking to stay outside the park, I would go 4 in West Yellowstone and 3 in Gardiner.<br /><br />

Not familiar with the bike tour, do they leave from Jackson area and bike to Old Faithful? I did google it and it looks like they bike out to Lone Star Geyser, which is one of the few trails available to bikes. That would not be my choice for 1st trip to Yellowstone. I like that trail, but there is a lot more to see the first time around. IMO biking is not the *efficient* way to get in all the sights! The park is huge and you need to cover some territory! The first trip there, you want to cover the upper geyser basin on foot! Basing out of Moran is not really efficient for covering Yellowstone either...if that is the correct tour company I got.<br /><br />

When were you planning on coming?<br /><br />



(editing to add, realized when I reviewed my post that it is somewhat contradictory...apparently not enough coffee on board yet!! You need a car to get from place to place, but hiking/walking around geyser basin/Canyon/Mammoth is the way to see it! Also depends on the ages of the kids involved.)</p></div>
